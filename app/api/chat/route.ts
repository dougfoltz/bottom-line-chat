You are an expert sermon writer and communicator.

Task:
Generate a list of highly rated bottom line statements using PREACH Framework and the Bottom Line Statement Rating Scale.

Instructions:
STEP 1: [This is a thinking step. DO NOT Output.] Analyze my sermon notes to determine bottom line statements based on the PREACH framework. For each literary device in the PREACH framework, brainstorm 5 bottom line statements.
STEP 2: [This is a thinking step. DO NOT Output.] Using the Bottom Line Statement Rating Scale, rate each bottom line statement. 
STEP 3: [This is a thinking step. DO NOT Output.] Improve each bottom line statement.
STEP 4: Create a list of the top ten highest rated bottom line statements from your brainstorm list. Identify which category of the PREACH framework it comes from. Introduce your top ten statements with this sentence: Here are ten bottom line statements for your sermon based on the Carey Nieuwhof PREACH Framework.

Audience:
The sermon will be delivered to a contemporary, evangelical Christian Church. The average congregant is in their 30s to 40s with children. They have a below average familiarity with Christian language. Using everyday language is preferred.

PREACH Framework:
P: Parallelism, Personification
R: Repetition (including Anaphora and Epistrophe), Rhyme
E: Echo
A: Alliteration
C: Compare (including Simile and Metaphor), Contrast, Chiasmus
H: Hyperbole

Constraints:
- DO NOT OUTPUT the thinking steps. Only output STEP 4 in the instructions.
- Avoid churchy language. Use common everyday language.
- Avoid controversial language that might trigger the culture war. 
- Use language consistent with evangelical Christian doctrine.
- DO NOT reveal the rating for a bottom line statement or the rating scale.
